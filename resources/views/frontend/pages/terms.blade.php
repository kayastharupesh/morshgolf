            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>1.1  We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at any time. Any such changes will take effect when posted on the website (see date at the top) and it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions on each occasion you use this website and your continued use of the website shall signify your acceptance to be bound by the latest terms and conditions.</p>
            <p>1.2  If you are purchasing on behalf of a business, you confirm that you have authority to bind said business on whose behalf you act, in using this website.</p>
            <h3>Order process</h3>
            <p>2.1  You place the order so that you give the product in the cart clicking “Add to cart” and then follow the process with clicking to “Proceed to Checkout” and “Place Order”. All orders that you place on this website will be subject to acceptance in accordance with these terms and conditions.</p>
            <p>2.2  The ‘confirmation’ stage sets out the final details of your order. Following this, we will send to you an order acknowledgement email, letting you know that your order had been received, stock is being re-checked and that we intend to process a payment from you. Please note that this email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from MorshGolf.</p>
            <p>2.3  Acceptance of your order, and the completion of the contract between you and us, will take place on dispatch of the products ordered from us to you, unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order, or you have cancelled it (please refer to our Guarantees and Returns Policy).</p>
            <p>2.4  We do not file details of your order for you to subsequently access direct on this website, and therefore, please print out these terms and conditions and the order acknowledgement for your own records. If you wish to obtain specific details of your previous orders please Contact Us.</p>
            <h3>Delivery</h3>
            <p>3.1   Please note that delivery times stated are accurate, and not guaranteed. This is because MorshGolf use a range of third party couriers like DHL, UPS etc to deliver products to your home or work. As such, factors that influence the ability of these companies to be on time, also affect us, and occasionally you. Previous examples include extreme weather conditions, or staff strikes or parcel sorting error at depot or when the doors are not answered within a reasonable time etc. We work closely with all of our delivery partners to ensure that such occurrences are rare and make a minimal impact on our customers. In all cases we cannot be held responsible or liable for any delays in delivery. </p>
            <p>3.2  Delivery charges and estimated timescales are specified in Shipping section, and also when you place an order. We make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timescales, however delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen factors affecting us or the third-party couriers we use.  MorshGolf shall be under no liability for any delay, or failure, to deliver the products within estimated timescales. </p>
            <p>3.3  Once a tracking number has been emailed to you directly from DHL or UPS, it is your responsibility to monitor and track the status of your parcel. If you notice any problems, for example – Address Not Found, Failed Delivery, Recipient Absent, etc, then please contact us immediately so we can assist with the resolution. Failed-delivery parcels are normally held at a local depot for a maximum of five days before returning back to us. It is therefore your responsibility to contact us in good time to advise us of this situation in order to stop any return. We take no responsibility for parcels returned to us after successive delivery attempts and any return charges will be passed to you.</p>
            <p>3.4  If the package has not been accepted, or rejected outside the valid reasons stated in 3.3, during delivery, the respective courier will make a return charge to MorshGolf. This charge will be required to be paid before processing a re-delivery, or will be retained if order has been cancelled.</p>
            <p>3.5  In the event where deliveries have failed due to incorrect address specified or if no one is available to accept delivery at time when courier attempts to deliver goods, the courier will hold the goods at their depot for a small period of time (anytime between 3-5 days). If a card has been left by the courier requesting you to contact them, you are requested to contact them to arrange a re-delivery at same address at a suitable time. Failure to do so quickly (normally within 2 working days) may cause the parcel to be returned back to us. Although every effort is made to ensure goods are delivered to you in good time and at address specified, certain circumstances may fail deliveries (for e.g. unable to find address or no one to accept parcel etc). In order to solve such problems during delivery or if you wish to advise us of change of delivery address after goods have been shipped, you are requested to contact us on first occasion. Normally a charge is incurred for amendments of delivery addresses, which can be accepted by yourself or you may simply arrange to collect the goods from the courier depot where possible without any charges. Failure to do so or if you advise a change of address directly with the courier without notifying us will incur an additional charge which will be passed on to you unless we have already authorised this change with the courier.</p>
            <p>3.6  Upon delivery it is your responsibility to check package and its contents thoroughly. If you notice any signs of security tape damage, theft or attempt for theft, damage of goods or any unacceptable condition of package and its contents you are requested not to accept the package. If you are willing to accept the package then you are requested to sign on the delivery note what you have noticed for e.g. Goods Damaged or Theft Attempt etc. Please note: failure to comply with these terms will prevent you making any claims against the above conditions and credit will not be issued.</p>
            <p>3.7  Risk of loss and damage to products is passed on to you on the date when the products are delivered, or on the date of first attempted delivery by our delivery agents. Please note that in cases where there has been lack of cooperation after our first delivery attempt to collect from a local depot or neighbour or failure to arrange a redelivery, MorshGolf will block accounts and put additional security measures to prevent further risk of this nature.</p>
            <p>3.8  MorshGolf reserves the right to withdraw delivery to you for whatever reason. There could be a number of reasons for example : failure to deliver by courier on multiple attempts, customer unwilling to compromise or is unreasonable in his/her demands, or failure to work with us in a professional and fair manner to resolve failures etc.  In such cases we will call the parcel back to our depot and a courier will return it back to us. A full refund will be issues, but only once the goods have been returned back to us or 28 days from the date of withdrawal whichever is sooner, or when the goods have been confirmed to be lost or stolen by the delivery agent.</p>
            <p>3.9  All goods must be signed for by an adult aged 18 years or over on delivery.</p>
            <h3>Payment</h3>
            <p>4.1  Prior to taking payment from your card, we implement a card and stock verification process, to ensure that the request for goods is genuine and that we have confirmed stock availability. All goods are subject to availability. In the event that we are unable to supply the goods, we will inform you of this as soon as possible. A full refund will be given where you have already paid for the goods and if no goods have been already dispatched. Refund of payment does not apply to personalised, custom-made or custom fitted goods.</p>

            <p>4.2  While we try and ensure that all prices on our website are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of goods you have ordered we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price, or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel, and you have already paid for the goods, you will receive a full refund.</p>

            <p>4.3  Payment can be made by any method specified in Payment Methods. For information about secure on-line ordering see Privacy</p>

            <p>4.4  All prices include VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rates but exclude delivery charges, unless expressly stated.  For further details, including Express delivery charges, see Shipping.</p>

            <p>4.5  Please note the VAT rate shown is local to Canada. This rate (and the final price you pay) may change if your order is being shipped to another country, as we may be obliged to charge VAT at the local rate in your country of destination.</p>

            <p>As per local Customs and Excise regulations, any delivery to EU countries whereby we have passed the VAT threshold limit the order will be subject to the standard local VAT rate of that country. The final cost of your order will be altered to reflect this.</p>
